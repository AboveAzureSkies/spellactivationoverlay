<h3>Spell Activation Overlay</h3>
<p>This WoW Classic addon mimics Spell Activation Overlays, formerly known as Spell Alerts, which were introduced in Cataclysm.</p>
<p>For example, Frost Death Knights can have procs for Rime and Killing Machine, while Enhancement Shamans have stacks of Maelstrom Weapon.</p>
<p>There is nothing to configure. Just install the addon and enjoy your procs!</p>
<h4>Supported overlays</h4>

<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The addon is very new.</p>
<p>Classes are implemented one after the other, and I don&rsquo;t pretend to know all effects of all classes anyway.</p>
